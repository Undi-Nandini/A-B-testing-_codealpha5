The project began with data preparation and loading, involving the import of necessary libraries and loading the 'marketing_AB.csv' dataset. Initial data inspection ensured data integrity by removing redundant columns like 'Unnamed: 0' and 'user id.' Univariate analysis was conducted on both categorical and numerical variables, generating various visualizations to understand data distributions and identify outliers. Bivariate analysis further explored relationships between variables and conversion rates across different categories. Statistical testing, including Chi-squared tests for categorical variables and Independent t-tests or Mann-Whitney U tests for numerical variables, assessed significance. Assumption checking ensured the reliability of results by evaluating normality and equality of variances. Finally, conclusions and insights were drawn, summarizing findings and providing actionable recommendations for marketing strategies and campaign optimization.
